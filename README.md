# NeuralNetworks

Implementation of neural networks for machine learning team project for AM218 spring.

### Environment

---

Python 3.7

Required packages: numpy, pandas, scipy

```python
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### Getting Started

---

Before running, make sure that the csv file of dataset has the corrent path in the project.

Running the **main.py** file in the project, you can get some results shown below.

### Files

- main.py
    - Main function
- tools.py
    - some useful tools
- networks.py
    - definition of NeuralNetworkClassifier
- _solver.py
    - definition of AdamOptimizer
- _functions.py
    - definition of activation function and loss function
