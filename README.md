# NeuralNetworks

Implementation of neural networks for machine learning team project for AM218 spring.

### Environment

---

Python 3.7

Required packages: numpy, pandas, scipy, matplotlib

```python
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### Getting Started

---

Before running, make sure that the csv file of dataset has the corrent path in the project.

Running the **main.py** file in the project, you can get some output like:
